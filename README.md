# CS-SSC-2017

## Labs 8-9
- The next 2 weeks we will have 3 labs in one-ish session.
- No longer are you to work in teams, each person will have to present their own work.
- You are required to bring all problems from each chapter, each representing a grade in the average.
- You can come and present all solutions in one week, presence for the other not being necessary.
- If you have questions I'll be at the labs.

## Prezentations can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VGLXKxtpqtUc-Al4cZIYvnaWCsUNCjas?usp=sharing)
