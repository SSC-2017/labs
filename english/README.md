# Computer security


## Lab hours

* Tuesdays
    - 8:00-10:00 B528b (Krody Robert)


## Student obligations

- Read the lab in advance (A quiz will be carried out at the start of each lab)
- Show up at all the labs (missed labs must be justified! and taken at a later date)
- All labs should be carried out inside a virtual machine! (not doing so will imply **lab failure**)


## Grading
```
final_grade = 50% lab_grade + 50% exam_grade
```

Partial grades do not round up!
Both grade components and the final must be `>=5` for the course to be considered taken.
All labs must have a passing grade! (must be `>=5`)


## Quiz

- When: start of each lab (don't be late or you'll lose time)
- Duration: 10-15min
- Subjects: the current week's subject (each lab will have a list of resource links)
- Worth: 30-40% of the lab's grade
- Means: Online multiple choice quiz


## Lab grade

At the end of each lab session you must showcase your results for the given tasks.


**Copying without explanations will result in failing the lab.**

We'll put emphasis more on you understanding what there is to be done and less on completing all the tasks (although it will be harder to get a 10).
These challenges will help you with the exam greatly so take them seriously!


## Lab presence and overcrowding

In case you happen to miss a lab session (with good reason!) you can join another group during the same week or at the
end of the semester.

**We'll only allow a maximum number of students to take the lab at the same time
(due to hardware limitations) but if you have a laptop you can come over this limit as long
as there are chairs in the lab and we have enough room. Priority will be given to those that had the hour in the first place.**



## Possible presentations for bonuses / lab marks week 10

If enough people wish we can replace one of the normal labs with a lab in which each student will present a topic regarding this security field,
be it a technology / hacks performed in the past etc.


Topic selection deadline - **week 6**
